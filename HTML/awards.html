        The Pr0teens are on their second year of FTC. This year's game, Freight Frenzy, requires us
        to transport freight such as cubes and spheres onto shipping hubs, spin a carousel wheel to
        deliver rubber ducks, and maneuver around field obstacles like pipes. Here are some of our
        accomplishments for this season:
        <p><b>Qualifier 1:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1st Place in 2021 Waterloo Qualifiers Freight Frenzy</b></li>
            <br>During the first qualifier, our team demonstrated our capabilities as a team to
            design, build, and program a robot to perform the various tasks required during Freight
            Frenzy.
            We were able to develop an efficient Autonomous and TeleOp strategy and carry it out
            successfully.
            <br><br>
            <li><b>Connect Award (2021-2022)</b></li>
            <br> We were also awarded for our various outreach efforts, aiming to spread knowledge
            of
            STEM throughout our community (see the Events page).
        </ul>
        <b>Qualifier 2:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>2nd Place in 2021 Freight Frenzy</b></li>
            <br>During the second qualifier, our team made many several changes to our robot
            hardware and programming.
            We were able to carry out our strategy even more efficiently.
        </ul>
        </p>

            Last year's game, Ultimate Goal, required a robot that could shoot rings into goals of
            various heights, knock down "power goals," and move wobble goals around the field. Here
            are some of our accomplishments for Ultimate Goal:
            <br><br>
            <b>Qualifier 1:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>1st Place Ranked Award (2020-2021)</b></li>
            <br>During the first qualifier, our team demonstrated our capabilities as a team to
            design, build, and program a robot to perform the various tasks required during the
            Ultimate Goal.<br><br>

            <li><b>Connect Award (2020-2021)</b></li>
            <br>Through our work with our community and outreach, our team proved our ability to
            spread knowledge about FIRST and allow those in our community to find opportunities with
            FIRST. This included our outreach events (See "Events") and other outreach efforts like
            our various social media accounts.<br><br>
        </ul>
        <b>Qualifier 2:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>2nd Place Ranked Award (2020-2021)</b></li>
            <br>During our second qualifier, our team once again worked our best to create an
            efficient and functioning robot and earned 2nd place for Ultimate Goal. <br><br>

            <li><b>Inspire Award (2020-2021)</b></li>
            <br>During this qualifier, our team also demonstrated the qualities of a role-model for
            FIRST teams through our teamwork and efforts while making the robot. We made a good
            candidate for all of the other awards.<br><br>
        </ul>
        <b>Provincial Championship:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>6th Place Ranked Award (2020-2021)</b></li>
            <br>During the provincials, we did our best to make huge changes to our robot in order
            to maximize efficiency and fit our ever-changing game strategy. We had decent runs with
            our new robot! <br><br>

            <li><b>Inspire Award (2020-2021)</b></li>
            <br>Once again for the provincials, our team was a role-model for other FIRST teams

            awards.<br><br>
