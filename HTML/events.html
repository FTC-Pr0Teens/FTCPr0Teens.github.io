        <h2>Ongoing Events</h2>
        <h3>Pr0teens Explore!</h3>
        <p> Since the start of the season, we've launched a new outreach campaign called: Pr0teens
            Explore!
            The series features various workshops teaching programming, mechanics and design.
            Our first workshop was held on November 25th, featuring Jason and HB teaching some 3D
            design basics!
            We've also launched a 3D design competition where students create their own designs.
            Our most recent workshop demonstrated some programming basics for robotics in Java.
            So far we have well over 20 submissions!
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>We've also launched a second workshop on coding called Pr0Teens Explore: Coding
                Challenge.
                This workshop was held on February 3 by, Iris Mo and Helen Yin. It was
                focused on Java for those who are beginners and have little to no experience in
                coding.
                The workshop will help students to tackle challenges after learning about basic
                programming structures and how to write simple programs.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We will be hosting more workshops in the future, so check out our instagram and twitter
            for more events in the future to give you some more experience in STEM.
        </p>

        <h3>Social Media Campaign</h3>
        <p> The Pr0Teens run social media accounts on various platforms including Instagram and
            Twitter!
            We post on these accounts regularly, aiming to increase knowledge and interaction based
            on robotics and technology through informative posts.
            Our other posts include polls, trivia, and Q&As to keep it more engaging for our
            audience! If you're interested in learning more about robotics and keeping up with our
            events, visit our social media accounts in the Contact page!

        <h2>Previous Events</h2>
        <h3>Summer Camp Outreach</h3>
        <p>
            Over the summer, the Pr0Teens partnered worked as a part of the FTC summer institute,
            at <b>Saint Ann Catholic Academy</b>, which provided programming and STEM opportunities
            for
            over 40 underserved students.
            This year, we plan on creating and expanding our own camp and are currently in contact
            with schools to set it up.
        </p>

        <h2>Future Events</h2>
        <h3>Pr0Teens Summer Robotics</h3>
        <p>
            In the future, we are planning to host a summer camp to teach students more about STEM.
            Our goal is to encourage people who are interested in STEM to share their knowledge with
            the community.
            We are currently making a curriculum to teach students about the programming, mechanics,
            3D design, and other aspects of building a robot. We also wish to encourage students to
            look for future opportunities in STEM, and to get them interested in certain careers
            related to robotics.
            Stay in touch, and don't miss out on this amazing opportunity to meet new people and
            learn more about STEM!
