            future plans. Below, we present to you an overview of our robot!

        <h3>Chassis</h3>
        <p>
            Our robot uses a frame with GoBilda parts, including motors, channels, brackets, beams,
            and more. It runs on mecanum wheels for a stronger base, easier driving during TeleOp,
            more consistency, and better support for odometry. It also provides us with a narrower
            base, which lets the robot navigate around the drive barrier. A raised flywheel is
            positioned behind the arm in the front of the robot to spin the carousel wheel and
            deliver ducks during TeleOp. Recently, we attached compliant wheels to the sides of the
            robot to prevent it from crashing into the wall.

        <h3>Intake</h3>
        <p>
            Our intake is one of the most innovative parts on our robot. We wanted a quick and
            efficient intake that could pick up all sorts of cargo quickly. In order to achieve
            this, we needed to connect a 3D-printed part to the arm. We used Fusion 360 for all of
            our 3D designs. Finalizing the intake took tons of trial and error, since the 3D printed
            part caused problems with durability and functionality. Now, our intake system follows
            these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>1. Intake the cargo by spinning the intake wheels and storing it in the 3D printed
                part
            </li>
            <li>2. Raise the arm to the desired level of the shipping hub</li>
            <li>3. Spin the intake wheels in the opposite direction to drop the cargo</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Arm</h3>
        <p>
            The arm of our robot works harmoniously with the intake system. Before the makeover, our
            robot used a simple four-bar arm. Now, we replaced it with an extendable boom in order
            to fit the size limit and reach efficiently for all levels of the shipping hub. It is
            responsible for lifting the intake system.

        <h3>Measuring Tape System</h3>
        <p>
            Recently, we added a 3D-printed measuring tape system controlled by a servo and
            two wheels. This system saves us valuable time in the Endgame phase, as we will be using
            it to drop the team shipping element onto the shipping hub without stopping the robot.
            To achieve this, we will use a camera to detect the shipping hub and rotate the
            measuring tape system appropriately.
